**ABSTRACT** : Real world applications such as aircraft design, motor drive controller design and space robot integration
simulation plays a prominent role. Simulation modelling aids to garner consensus and generate confidence for the
design which was/is tried and tested. Simulation modelling acquires information about how something will behave
without actually testing it in real life. One such type of simulation is network about how system behaves externally
without actually testing it in real life. In this paper, we have examined one such type of simulation known as network
simulation. In computer networking research, network simulation is a technique which models the behaviour of
different network entities under different conditions. Our paper provides and overall analysis on divergent species of
simulators used in networking models.

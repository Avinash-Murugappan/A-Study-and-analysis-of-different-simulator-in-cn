**ABSTRACT** : Real world applications such as aircraft design, motor drive controller design and space robot integration
simulation plays a prominent role. Simulation modelling aids to garner consensus and generate confidence for the
design which was/is tried and tested. Simulation modelling acquires information about how something will behave
without actually testing it in real life. One such type of simulation is network about how system behaves externally
without actually testing it in real life. In this paper, we have examined one such type of simulation known as network
simulation. In computer networking research, network simulation is a technique which models the behaviour of
different network entities under different conditions. Our paper provides and overall analysis on divergent species of
simulators used in networking models.

**KEYWORDS** : _Computer networks; Network simulation; Network simulator_

### I. INTRODUCTION

At present, performing data communication in a network is one of the rapidly growing technologies. Sending the
required information from one place to another place is extremely complex without networking. Can you imagine
world without google, online newspapers, blogs, forums and other web services offered by the internet using network?
Today, computer networks are the core of modern communication. Computer networking benefits the people to share
the resources during data communication. Network manages all the program, data and hardware available to everyone
in the network without any regard of physical location of users and their resources.

Computer networking is one of the very few profession in which top 25% workers make over $100,000. Computer
network is fastest occupation for the need of system administrator who can help organizations to achieve increased
firms.Networking has excellent research opportunities in the fields of military reconnaissance, Artificial Intelligence,

Remote sensing and wireless sensor networks. Computer network finds its applications in various fields such as
business, smart homes, mobile users, social networks, organization, education, telecommunication, media, industry,
science, research and development etc. Advancement of technologies has proved itself that performing data
communication is huge faster with expanded bandwidth capacity. Therefore, computer network guides people who live
or work apart.

Balancing information and communication between any two entities is one of the tedious tasks to run a successful
organization. To represent the physical view of information and communication we need computer systems. To manage
and maintain both information and communication we need networks. Computer network is the process of transmitting
or exchanging information/data between two different devices being connected. Connection can be either wired or
wireless medium. When wired communication takes place between two different devices we use cables as transmission
medium.

Advantages of networks are easy file sharing, sharing resources such as printers, Internet connections, and
centralized data communication using file server for ease of access and back-up. Disadvantages of networks are
vulnerable to hackers, if the network fails then other task becomes very difficult, easily attacked by unauthorized users.
Similarly, when computer connected to Internet can find loopholes such as revealing personal information, suspecting
websites that are malware, sometimes information in Internet is not always accurate or reliable. The use of network
with respect to organization is cost reduction because it shares the hardware and software resources, high reliability
because multiple sources of supply, greater flexibility because of possibility to connect devices from various vendors.

Data Communication is the movement of computer information from one device to another device forming a
network. Client computers connected together to create a network which is termed to be servers and clients. Client
computers or workstations are the normal computers where people sit at to get their work done. Servers are special,
powerful computers that provide “services” to the client computers in the network. Servers provides a central, common
file storage area, sharing hardware such as printers, controlling who can or can’t have access to the network and sharing
Internet connections. Servers are built to be very reliable.

```
A. Benefits of Computer Network
```
```
● File Sharing: Networking of computers helps the users to share data files such as emails, instant messaging,
video telephone, cat rooms etc.
● Hardware sharing: Users can share devices such as printers, scanners, CD-ROM, drivers, hard drives etc.
● Application sharing: Applications can be shared over the network, and this allows to implement client/server
applications.
● User communication: Networks allow users to communicate using email, newsgroups and video
conferencing etc.
● Network gaming: A lot of network games available allows multi-users to play from different locations.

Simulation is meant to be a network entity (node, host, packets) flow process [3]. Simulation [2] “Process of
designing a real system model and conducting experiments with this model to understand the behaviour of the system
and evaluating various procedures for the operation of the system”.Network simulation is used to validate protocol,
control experimental conditions, low cost in terms of $, time, collaboration and complexity. The main objective of
simulation is to generate statistical results that represent the behaviour of certain network entities and their operations.
Key elements used in simulation are as follows [1],
```
```
● Performance Modelling
● Failure Analysis
● Network Design
● Network resource planning
● Reusability
● Availability
● Scalability
● Graphical, debug and trace support
In a network, if real system is not available, complex, costly or dangerous (e.g. space simulations, flight simulations),
to quickly evaluate design alternatives and evaluate complex functions for which closed form formulas or numerical
techniques not available, then we tend to prefer simulations in that particular network. Network Simulation (Ns) [5]
itself is derived from REAL (Realistic and Large) which in turn is derived from NEST (Network Simulation Testbed).
TABLE I shows the difference between testbed and simulator advantages and disadvantages [21].
```
**Platform Advantages Disadvantages**
Testbed Fast , Accurate, Ground truth Expensive
Shared resource????Hard to reconfigure, Hard
to change, Hard to download

Simulator Inexpensive, Flexible, Easy to
download virtual time (faster than
reality”), performance of a real-life
system (latency time, packet loss, etc.)

May require app changes might not run OS

J. NetSim
```
Netsim is a network simulator used for modelling protocols, analyse networks in terms of depth, power and
flexibility. It is mainly applicable in research and development and defence applications. Basically, most of the
networks related to communication among data is complex to provide an accurate analysis of system behaviour. Hence,
Netsim Analyses the parameters such as arrival time of the packet, queuing time of the data in buffer, payload of data,
overhead, and error for every packet as it flows through the network. It also records the event traces logging every
single event in the protocol and finite state machine transitions along with associated information like time-stamp,
event id, and event type.

It provides the simulation visualization to animate the packet flow via wired and wireless links, the control packets,
data packets, and error packets. Apart from animation, result analyses the output performance metrics such as network,
sub network, link, queue, application, throughput, delay, loss, packet error, link utilization. Application [27] that
